const Textile = "Textile is a lightweight markup language that uses a text formatting syntax to\nconvert plain text into structured HTML markup. The syntax is a shorthand\nversion of HTML that is designed to be easy to read and write. Textile is used\nfor writing articles, forum posts, readme documentation, and any other type of\nwritten content published online.\n\n- [Comments](#comments)\n- [Paragraphs](#paragraphs)\n- [Headings](#headings)\n- [Simple Text Styles](#simple-text-styles)\n- [Lists](#lists)\n- [Code blocks](#code-blocks)\n- [Horizontal rule](#horizontal-rule)\n- [Links](#links)\n- [Images](#images)\n- [Footnotes and Endnotes](#footnotes-and-endnotes)\n- [Tables](#tables)\n- [Character Conversions](#character-conversions)\n- [CSS](#css)\n- [Spans and Divs](#spans-and-divs)\n- [Additional Info](#additional-info)\n\n## Comments\n\n```\n###. Comments begin with three (3) '#' signs followed by a full-stop period '.'.\nComments can span multiple lines until a blank line is reached.\n\n###..\nMulti-line comments (including blank lines) are indicated by three (3) '#'\nsigns followed by two (2) full-stop periods '..'.\n\nThis line is also part of the above comment.\n\nThe comment continues until the next block element is reached\n\np. This line is not commented\n\n<!-- HTML comments are also…\n\nrespected -->\n\n```\n\n## Paragraphs\n\n```\n###. Paragraphs are a one or multiple adjacent lines of text separated by one or\nmultiple blank lines. They can also be indicated explicitly with a 'p. '\n\nThis is a paragraph. I'm typing in a paragraph isn't this fun?\n\nNow I'm in paragraph 2.\nI'm still in paragraph 2 too!\nLine breaks without blank spaces are equivalent to a <br /> in XHTML.\n\np. I'm an explicitly defined paragraph\n\n Lines starting with a blank space are not wrapped in <p>..</p> tags.\n\n###. Paragraphs (and all block elements) can be aligned using shorthand:\n\np<. Left aligned paragraph (default).\n\np>. Right aligned paragraph.\n\np=. Centered paragraph.\n\np<>. Justified paragraph.\n\nh3>. Right aligned <h3>\n\n\n###. Paragraphs can be indented using a parentheses for each em\nIndentation utilizes padding-[left/right] css styles.\n\np(. Left indent 1em.\n\np((. Left indent 2em.\n\np))). Right indent 3em.\n\nh2). This is equivalent to <h2 style=\"padding-right: 1em;\">..</h2>\n\n\n###. Block quotes use the tag 'bq.'\n\nbq. This is a block quote.\n\nbq.:http://someurl.com You can include a citation URL immediately after the '.'\n\nbq.. Multi-line blockquotes containing\n\nblank lines are indicated using two periods\n\np. Multi-line blockquotes continue until a new block element is reached.\n\nbq. You can add a footer to a blockquote using html:\n<footer>citation text</footer>\n\n\n###. Preformatted text blocks:\n\npre. This text is preformatted.  <= those two spaces will carry through.\n\npre.. This is a multi-line preformatted…\n\n…text block that includes blank lines\n\np. End a multi-line preformatted text block with a new block element.\n\n```\n\n## Headings\n\nYou can create HTML elements `<h1>` through `<h6>` easily by prepending the\ntext you want to be in that element by 'h#.' where # is the level 1-6.\nA blank line is required after headings.\n\n\n```\nh1. This is an <h1>\n\nh2. This is an <h2>\n\nh3. This is an <h3>\n\nh4. This is an <h4>\n\nh5. This is an <h5>\n\nh6. This is an <h6>\n\n```\n\n\n## Simple text styles\n\n```\n###. Bold and strong text are indicated using asterisks:\n\n*This is strong text*\n**This is bold text**\nThis is [*B*]old text within a word.\n\n*Strong* and **Bold** usually display the same in browsers\nbut they use different HTML markup, thus the distinction.\n\n###. Italics and emphasized text are indicated using underscores.\n\n_This is Emphasized text_\n__This is Italics text__\nThis is It[_al_]ics within a word.\n\n_Emphasized_ and __Italics__ text typically display the same in browsers,\nbut again, they use different HTML markup and thus the distinction.\n\n###. Superscripts and Subscripts use carats and tildes:\n\nSuperscripts are 2 ^nd^ to none, but subscripts are CO ~2~ L too.\nNote the spaces around the superscripts and subscripts.\n\nTo avoid the spaces, add square brackets around them:\n2[^nd^] and CO[~2~]L\n\n###. Insertions and deletions are indicated using -/+ symbols:\nThis is -deleted- text and this is +inserted+ text.\n\n###. Citations are indicated using double '?':\n\n??This is a cool citation??\n\n```\n\n## Lists\n\n```\n###. Unordered lists can be made using asterisks '*' to indicate levels:\n\n* Item\n** Sub-Item\n* Another item\n** Another sub-item\n** Yet another sub-item\n*** Three levels deep\n\n###. Ordered lists are done with a pound sign '#':\n\n# Item one\n# Item two\n## Item two-a\n## Item two-b\n# Item three\n** Mixed unordered list within ordered list\n\n###. Ordered lists can start above 1 and can continue after another block:\n\n#5 Item 5\n# Item 6\n\nadditional paragraph\n\n#_ Item 7 continued from above\n# Item 8\n\n###. Definition lists are indicated with a dash and assignment:\n\n- First item := first item definition\n- Second := second def.\n- Multi-line :=\nMulti-line\ndefinition =:\n```\n\n## Code blocks\n\n```\nCode blocks use the 'bc.' shorthand:\n\nbc. This is code\n    So is this\n\nThis is outside of the code block\n\nbc.. This is a multi-line code block\n\nBlank lines are included in the multi-line code block\n\np. End a multi-line code block with any block element\n\np. Indicate @inline code@ using the '@' symbol.\n\n```\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nHorizontal rules (`<hr/>`) are easily added with two hyphens\n\n```\n--\n```\n\n## Links\n\n```\n###. Link text is in quotes, followed by a colon and the URL:\n\n\"Link text\":http://linkurl.com/ plain text.\n\n\"Titles go in parentheses at the end of the link text\"(mytitle):http://url.com\n###. produces <a href... title=\"mytitle\">...</a>\n\n###. Use square brackets when the link text or URL might be ambiguous:\n[\"Textile on Wikipedia\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)]\n\n###. Named links are useful if the same URL is referenced multiple times.\nMultiple \"references\":txstyle to the \"txstyle\":txstyle website.\n\n[txstyle]https://txstyle.org/\n\n```\n\n## Images\n\n```\n###. Images can be included by surrounding its URL with exclamation marks (!)\nAlt text is included in parenthesis after the URL, and they can be linked too:\n\n!http://imageurl.com!\n\n!http://imageurl.com(image alt-text)!\n\n!http://imageurl.com(alt-text)!:http://image-link-url.com\n\n```\n\n## Footnotes and Endnotes\n\n```\nA footnote is indicated with the reference id in square brackets.[1]\n\nfn1. Footnote text with a \"link\":http://link.com.\n\nA footnote without a link.[2!]\n\nfn2. The corresponding unlinked footnote.\n\nA footnote with a backlink from the footnote back to the text.[3]\n\nfn3^. This footnote links back to the in-text citation.\n\n\nEndnotes are automatically numbered[#first] and are indicated using square[#second]\nbrackets and a key value[#first]. They can also be unlinked[#unlinkednote!]\n\n###. Give the endnotes text:\n\nnote#first. This is the first endnote text.\n\nnote#second. This is the second text.\n\nnote#unlinkednote. This one isn't linked from the text.\n\n### Use the notelist block to place the list of notes in the text:\nThis list will start with #1. Can also use alpha or Greeks.\nnotelist:1. ###. start at 1 (then 2, 3, 4...)\nnotelist:c. ###. start at c (then d, e, f...)\nnotelist:α. ###. start at α (then β, γ, δ...)\n\n###. The notelist syntax is as follows:\n\nnotelist.    Notes with backlinks to every citation made to them.\nnotelist+.   Notes with backlinks to every citation made to them,\n               followed by the unreferenced notes.\nnotelist^.   Notes with one backlink to the first citation made to each note.\nnotelist^+.  Notes with one backlink to the first citation made to each note,\n               followed by unreferenced notes.\nnotelist!.   Notes with no backlinks to the citations.\nnotelist!+.  Notes with no backlinks to the citations, followed by \n               unreferenced notes.\n```\n\n## Tables\n\n\n```\n###. Tables are simple to define using the pipe '|' symbol\n\n| A | simple | table | row |\n| And | another | table | row |\n| With an | | empty | cell |\n\n###. Headers are preceded by '|_.'\n|_. First Header |_. Second Header |\n| Content Cell | Content Cell |\n\n###. The <thead> tag is added when |^. above and |-. below the heading are used.\n\n|^.\n|_. First Header |_.

A footer, centered & across two columns |\n|-.\n| Content Cell | Content Cell |\n| Content Cell | Content Cell |\n\n###. Attributes are be applied either to individual cells, rows, or to\nthe entire table. Cell attributes are placed within each cell:\n\n|a|{color:red}. styled|cell|\n\n###. Row attributes are placed at the beginning of a row,\nfollowed by a dot and a space:\n\n(rowclass). |a|classy|row|\n\n###. Table attributes are specified by placing the special 'table.' block\nmodifier immediately before the table:\n\ntable(tableclass).\n|a|classy|table|\n|a|classy|table|\n\n###. Spanning rows and colums:\nA backslash \\ is used for a column span:\n\n|\\2. spans two cols |\n| col 1 | col 2 |\n\n###. A forward slash / is used for a row span:\n\n|/3. spans 3 rows | row a |\n| row b |\n| row c |\n\n###. Vertical alignments within a table cell:\n\n|^. top alignment|\n|-. middle alignment|\n|~. bottom alignment|\n\n###. Horizontal alignments within a table cell\n\n|:\\1. |400|\n|=. center alignment |\n| no alignment |\n|>. right alignment |\n\n```\nor, for the same results\n\n```\nCol 1 | Col2 | Col3\n:-- | :-: | --:\nUgh this is so ugly | make it | stop\n```\n\n\n## Character Conversions\n\n### Registered, Trademark, Copyright Symbols\n\n```\nRegisteredTrademark(r), Trademark(tm), Copyright (c)\n```\n\n### Acronyms\n\n```\n###.

Numbers separated by the letter 'x' translate to the multiplication\nor dimension symbol '×':\n3 x 5 => 3 × 5\n```\n\n### Quotes and Apostrophes\n\n```\n###. Straight quotes and apostrophes are automatically converted to\ntheir curly equivalents:\n\n\"these\", 'these', and this'n are converted to their HTML entity equivalents.\nLeave them straight using '==' around the text: ==\"straight quotes\"==.\n```\n\n## CSS\n\n```\np{color:blue}.
