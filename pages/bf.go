const Bf = "Brainfuck (not capitalized except at the start of a sentence) is an extremely\nminimal Turing-complete programming language with just 8 commands.\n\nYou can try brainfuck on your browser with [brainfuck-visualizer](http://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/).\n\n```bf\nAny character not \"><+-.,[]\" (excluding quotation marks) is ignored.\n\nBrainfuck is represented by an array with 30,000 cells initialized to zero\nand a data pointer pointing at the current cell.\n\nThere are eight commands:\n+ : Increments the value at the current cell by one.\n- : Decrements the value at the current cell by one.\n> : Moves the data pointer to the next cell (cell on the right).\n< : Moves the data pointer to the previous cell (cell on the left).\n. : Prints the ASCII value at the current cell (i.e. 65 = 'A').\n, : Reads a single input character into the current cell.\n[ : If the value at the current cell is zero, skips to the corresponding ] .\n    Otherwise, move to the next instruction.\n] : If the value at the current cell is zero, move to the next instruction.\n    Otherwise, move backwards in the instructions to the corresponding [ .\n\n[ and ] form a while loop. Obviously, they must be balanced.\n\nLet's look at some basic brainfuck programs.\n\n++++++ [ > ++++++++++ < - ] > +++++ .\n\nThis program prints out the letter 'A'. First, it increments cell #1 to 6.\nCell #1 will be used for looping. Then, it enters the loop ([) and moves\nto cell #2. It increments cell #2 10 times, moves back to cell #1, and\ndecrements cell #1. This loop happens 6 times (it takes 6 decrements for\ncell #1 to reach 0, at which point it skips to the corresponding ] and\ncontinues on).\n\nAt this point, we're on cell #1, which has a value of 0, while cell #2 has a\nvalue of 60. We move on cell #2, increment 5 times, for a value of 65, and then\nprint cell #2's value. 65 is 'A' in ASCII, so 'A' is printed to the terminal.\n\n\n, [ > + < - ] > .\n\nThis program reads a character from the user input and copies the character into\ncell #1. Then we start a loop. Move to cell #2, increment the value at cell #2,\nmove back to cell #1, and decrement the value at cell #1. This continues on\nuntil cell #1 is 0, and cell #2 holds cell #1's old value. Because we're on\ncell #1 at the end of the loop, move to cell #2, and then print out the value\nin ASCII.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the spaces are purely for readability purposes. You\ncould just as easily write it as:\n\n,[>+<-]>.\n\nTry and figure out what this program does:\n\n,>,< [ > [ >+ >+ << -] >> [- << + >>] <<< -] >>\n\nThis program takes two numbers for input, and multiplies them.\n\nThe gist is it first reads in two inputs. Then it starts the outer loop,\nconditioned on cell #1. Then it moves to cell #2, and starts the inner\nloop conditioned on cell #2, incrementing cell #3. However, there comes a\nproblem: At the end of the inner loop, cell #2 is zero. In that case,\ninner loop won't work anymore since next time. To solve this problem,\nwe also increment cell #4, and then recopy cell #4 into cell #2.\nThen cell #3 is the result.\n```\n\nAnd that's brainfuck. Not that hard, eh? For fun, you can write your own\nbrainfuck programs, or you can write a brainfuck interpreter in another\nlanguage. The interpreter is fairly simple to implement, but if you're a\nmasochist, try writing a brainfuck interpreter… in brainfuck."
