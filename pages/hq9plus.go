const Hq9Plus = "HQ9+ is a joke programming language created by Cliff Biffle. It has only four commands and it isn't Turing-complete.\n\n```\nThere is only 4 commands, represented by next characters\nH: print \"Hello, world!\"\nQ: print the program's source code (a Quine)\n9: print the lyrics to \"99 Bottles of Beer\"\n+: add one to the accumulator (the value of the accumulator cannot be accessed)\nAny other character is ignored.\n\nOk. Let's write some program:\n  HQ9\n\nResult:\n  Hello world!\n  HQ9\n\nHQ9+ is very simple, but allows you to do some things that are very difficult\nin other languages. For example, here is a program that creates three copies of\nitself on the screen:\n  QQQ\n\nThis produces:\n  QQQ\n  QQQ\n  QQQ\n```\n\nAnd that's all. There are a lot of interpreters for HQ9+. Below you can find one of them\n\n+ [One of online interpreters](https://almnet.de/esolang/hq9plus.php)\n+ [HQ9+ official website](http://cliffle.com/esoterica/hq9plus.html)"
