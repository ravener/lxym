const Rst = "RST, Restructured Text, is a file format created by the Python community to write documentation. It is part of [Docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).\n\nRST is a markdown language like HTML but is much more lightweight and easier to read.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use Restructured Text, you will have to install [Python](http://www.python.org) and the `docutils` package.\n\n`docutils` can be installed using the commandline:\n\n```bash\n$ easy_install docutils\n```\n\nIf your system has `pip`, you can use it too:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install docutils\n```\n\n\n## File syntax\n\nA simple example of the file syntax:\n\n```\n.. Lines starting with two dots are special commands. But if no command can be found, the line is considered as a comment\n\n=========================================================\nMain titles are written using equals signs over and under\n=========================================================\n\nNote that each character, including spaces, needs an equals sign above and below.\n\nTitles also use equals signs but are only underneath\n====================================================\n\nSubtitles with dashes\n---------------------\n\nYou can put text in *italic* or in **bold**, you can \"mark\" text as code with double backquote ``print()``.\n\nSpecial characters can be escaped using a backslash, e.g. \\\\ or \\*.\n\nLists are similar to Markdown, but a little more involved.\n\nRemember to line up list symbols (like - or \\*) with the left edge of the previous text block, and remember to use blank lines to separate new lists from parent lists:    \n\n- First item\n- Second item\n\n  - Sub item\n    \n- Third item\n\nor\n\n* First item\n* Second item\n    \n  * Sub item\n\n* Third item\n\nTables are really easy to write:\n\n=========== ========\nCountry     Capital\n=========== ========\nFrance      Paris\nJapan       Tokyo\n=========== ========\n\nMore complex tables can be done easily (merged columns and/or rows) but I suggest you to read the complete doc for this :)\n\nThere are multiple ways to make links:\n\n- By adding an underscore after a word : Github_ and by adding the target URL after the text (this way has the advantage of not inserting unnecessary URLs in the visible text).\n- By typing a full comprehensible URL : https://github.com/ (will be automatically converted to a link)\n- By making a more Markdown-like link: `Github <https://github.com/>`_ .\n\n.. _Github: https://github.com/\n\n```\n\n\n## How to Use It\n\nRST comes with docutils where you have `rst2html`, for example:\n\n```bash\n$ rst2html myfile.rst output.html\n```\n\n*Note : On some systems the command could be rst2html.py*\n\nBut there are more complex applications that use the RST format:\n\n- [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a static site generator\n- [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), a documentation generator\n- and many others\n\n\n## Readings\n\n- [Official quick reference](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html)"
