const Markdown = "Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004. It's meant to be an easy to read \nand write syntax which converts easily to HTML (and now many other formats as \nwell).\n\nMarkdown also varies in implementation from one parser to a next. This\nguide will attempt to clarify when features are universal or when they are\nspecific to a certain parser.\n\n- [HTML Elements](#html-elements)\n- [Headings](#headings)\n- [Simple Text Styles](#simple-text-styles)\n- [Paragraphs](#paragraphs)\n- [Lists](#lists)\n- [Code blocks](#code-blocks)\n- [Horizontal rule](#horizontal-rule)\n- [Links](#links)\n- [Images](#images)\n- [Miscellany](#miscellany)\n\n## HTML Elements\nMarkdown is a superset of HTML, so any HTML file is valid Markdown.\n\n```md\n<!--This means we can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment \nelement, and they won't be affected by a markdown parser. However, if you \ncreate an HTML element in your markdown file, you cannot use markdown syntax \nwithin that element's contents.-->\n```\n\n## Headings\n\nYou can create HTML elements `<h1>` through `<h6>` easily by prepending the\ntext you want to be in that element by a number of hashes (#).\n\n```md\n# This is an <h1>\n## This is an <h2>\n### This is an <h3>\n#### This is an <h4>\n##### This is an <h5>\n###### This is an <h6>\n```\nMarkdown also provides us with two alternative ways of indicating h1 and h2.\n\n```md\nThis is an h1\n=============\n\nThis is an h2\n-------------\n```\n\n## Simple text styles\n\nText can be easily styled as italic or bold using markdown.\n\n```md\n*This text is in italics.*\n_And so is this text._\n\n**This text is in bold.**\n__And so is this text.__\n\n***This text is in both.***\n**_As is this!_**\n*__And this!__*\n```\n\nIn GitHub Flavored Markdown, which is used to render markdown files on\nGitHub, we also have strikethrough:\n\n```md\n~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~\n```\n## Paragraphs\n\nParagraphs are a one or multiple adjacent lines of text separated by one or\nmultiple blank lines.\n\n```md\nThis is a paragraph. I'm typing in a paragraph isn't this fun?\n\nNow I'm in paragraph 2.\nI'm still in paragraph 2 too!\n\n\nI'm in paragraph three!\n```\n\nShould you ever want to insert an HTML `<br />` tag, you can end a paragraph\nwith two or more spaces and then begin a new paragraph.\n\n```md\nI end with two spaces (highlight me to see them).\n\nThere's a <br /> above me!\n```\n\nBlock quotes are easy and done with the > character.\n\n```md\n> This is a block quote. You can either\n> manually wrap your lines and put a `>` before every line or you can let your lines get really long and wrap on their own.\n> It doesn't make a difference so long as they start with a `>`.\n\n> You can also use more than one level\n>> of indentation?\n> How neat is that?\n\n```\n\n## Lists\nUnordered lists can be made using asterisks, pluses, or hyphens.\n\n```md\n* Item\n* Item\n* Another item\n\nor\n\n+ Item\n+ Item\n+ One more item\n\nor\n\n- Item\n- Item\n- One last item\n```\n\nOrdered lists are done with a number followed by a period.\n\n```md\n1. Item one\n2. Item two\n3. Item three\n```\n\nYou don't even have to label the items correctly and Markdown will still\nrender the numbers in order, but this may not be a good idea.\n\n```md\n1. Item one\n1. Item two\n1. Item three\n```\n(This renders the same as the above example)\n\nYou can also use sublists\n\n```md\n1. Item one\n2. Item two\n3. Item three\n    * Sub-item\n    * Sub-item\n4. Item four\n```\n\nThere are even task lists. This creates HTML checkboxes.\n\n```md\nBoxes below without the 'x' are unchecked HTML checkboxes.\n- [ ] First task to complete.\n- [ ] Second task that needs done\nThis checkbox below will be a checked HTML checkbox.\n- [x] This task has been completed\n```\n\n## Code blocks\n\nYou can indicate a code block (which uses the `<code>` element) by indenting\na line with four spaces or a tab.\n\n```md\n    This is code\n    So is this\n```\n\nYou can also re-tab (or add an additional four spaces) for indentation\ninside your code\n\n```md\n    my_array.each do |item|\n        puts item\n    end\n```\n\nInline code can be created using the backtick character `` ` ``\n\n```md\nJohn didn't even know what the `go_to()` function did!\n```\n\nIn GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a special syntax for code\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"highlight\">&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ruby\ndef foobar\n    puts \"Hello world!\"\nend\n&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</code></pre>\n\nThe above text doesn't require indenting, plus GitHub will use syntax\nhighlighting of the language you specify after the \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nHorizontal rules (`<hr/>`) are easily added with three or more asterisks or \nhyphens, with or without spaces.\n\n```md\n***\n---\n- - -\n****************\n```\n\n## Links\n\nOne of the best things about markdown is how easy it is to make links. Put\nthe text to display in hard brackets [] followed by the url in parentheses ()\n\n```md\n[Click me!](http://test.com/)\n```\nYou can also add a link title using quotes inside the parentheses.\n\n```md\n[Click me!](http://test.com/ \"Link to Test.com\")\n```\nRelative paths work too.\n\n```md\n[Go to music](/music/).\n```\n\nMarkdown also supports reference style links.\n\n<pre><code class=\"highlight\">&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">Click this link</span>][<span class=\"ss\">link1</span>] for more info about it!\n&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">Also check out this link</span>][<span class=\"ss\">foobar</span>] if you want to.\n\n&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">link1</span>]: <span class=\"sx\">http://test.com/</span> <span class=\"nn\">\"Cool!\"</span>\n&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">foobar</span>]: <span class=\"sx\">http://foobar.biz/</span> <span class=\"nn\">\"Alright!\"</span></code></pre>\n\nThe title can also be in single quotes or in parentheses, or omitted\nentirely. The references can be anywhere in your document and the reference IDs\ncan be anything so long as they are unique.\n\nThere is also \"implicit naming\" which lets you use the link text as the id.\n\n<pre><code class=\"highlight\">&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">This</span>][] is a link.\n\n&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">this</span>]: <span class=\"sx\">http://thisisalink.com/</span></code></pre>\n\nBut it's not that commonly used.\n\n## Images\nImages are done the same way as links but with an exclamation point in front!\n\n```md\n![This is the alt-attribute for my image](http://imgur.com/myimage.jpg \"An optional title\")\n```\n\nAnd reference style works as expected.\n\n<pre><code class=\"highlight\">!&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">This is the alt-attribute.</span>][<span class=\"ss\">myimage</span>]\n\n&#x5b;<span class=\"nv\">myimage</span>]: <span class=\"sx\">relative/urls/cool/image.jpg</span> <span class=\"nn\">\"if you need a title, it's here\"</span></code></pre>\n## Miscellany\n### Auto-links\n\n```md\n<http://testwebsite.com/> is equivalent to\n[http://testwebsite.com/](http://testwebsite.com/)\n```\n\n### Auto-links for emails\n\n```md\n<foo@bar.com>\n```\n\n### Escaping characters\n\n```md\nI want to type *this text surrounded by asterisks* but I don't want it to be\nin italics, so I do this: \\*this text surrounded by asterisks\\*.\n```\n\n### Keyboard keys\n\nIn GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a `<kbd>` tag to represent keyboard \nkeys.\n\n```md\nYour computer crashed? Try sending a\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>\n```\n### Tables\n\nTables are only available in GitHub Flavored Markdown and are slightly\ncumbersome, but if you really want it:\n\n```md\n| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |\n| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |\n| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |\n| blah         | blah     | blah          |\n```\nor, for the same results\n\n```md\nCol 1 | Col2 | Col3\n:-- | :-: | --:\nUgh this is so ugly | make it | stop\n```\n\n---\nFor more info, check out John Gruber's official post of syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and Adam Pritchard's great cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)."
