const Go = "Go was created out of the need to get work done.

It's easy to read\nand amazingly short (as language definitions go these days.)\n\nYou can play around with the code on [Go playground](https://play.golang.org/p/tnWMjr16Mm). Try to change it and run it from your browser! Note that you can use [https://play.golang.org](https://play.golang.org) as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) to test things and code in your browser, without even installing Go.\n\nOn the reading list for students of Go is the [source code to the standard\nlibrary](http://golang.org/src/pkg/). Comprehensively documented, it\ndemonstrates the best of readable and understandable Go, Go style, and Go\nidioms. Or you can click on a function name in [the\ndocumentation](http://golang.org/pkg/) and the source code comes up!\n\nAnother great resource to learn Go is [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/).\n\nThere are many excellent conference talks and video tutorials on Go available on YouTube, and here are three playlists of the very best, tailored for beginners, intermediate, and advanced Gophers respectively:\n* [Golang University 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEcwzBXTPUE9V1o8mZdC9tNnRZaTgI-1P) introduces fundamental Go concepts and shows you how to use the Go tools to create and manage Go code\n* [Golang University 201](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEcwzBXTPUE_5m_JaMXmGEFgduH8EsuTs) steps it up a notch, explaining important techniques like testing, web services, and APIs\n* [Golang University 301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHRO5WQGh0k&list=PLEcwzBXTPUE8KvXRFmmfPEUmKoy9LfmAf) dives into more advanced topics like the Go scheduler, implementation of maps and channels, and optimisation techniques\n\nGo Mobile adds support for mobile platforms (Android and iOS). You can write all-Go native mobile apps or write a library that contains bindings from a Go package, which can be invoked via Java (Android) and Objective-C (iOS). Check out the [Go Mobile page](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) for more information."
