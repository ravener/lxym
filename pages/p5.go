const P5 = "p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of [Processing](https://processing.org), to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.\nSince p5 is a JavaScript library, you should learn [Javascript](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/) first.\n\n```js\n///////////////////////////////////\n// p5.js has two important functions to work with.\n\nfunction setup() {\n    // the setup function gets executed just once when the window is loaded\n}\nfunction draw() {\n    // the draw function gets called every single frame. This means that for a frameRate(30) it would get called 30 times per second.\n}\n\n// the following code explains all features\n\nfunction setup() {\n    createCanvas(640, 480); // creates a new canvas element with 640px as width as 480px as height\n    background(128); // changes the background color of the canvas, can accept rgb values like background(100,200,20) else grayscale values like background(0) = black or background(255) = white\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n    ellipse(10, 10, 50, 50); // creates a ellipse at the 10px from the left and 10px from the top with width adn height as 50 each, so its basically a circle.\n    //remember in p5.js the origin is at the top-left corner of the canvas\n\n    if (mouseIsPressed) {\n        // mouseIsPressed is a boolean variable that changes to true if the mouse buttton is pressed down at that instant\n\n        fill(0); // fill refers to the innner color or filling color of whatever shape you are going to draw next\n    } else {\n        fill(255); // you can give in rgb values like fill(72, 240, 80) to get colors, else a single values determines the grayscale where fill(255) stands for #FFF(white) and fill(0) stands for #000(black)\n    }\n\n    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);\n    // mouseX is the x-coordinate of the mouse's current position and mouseY is the y-coordinate of the mouse's current position\n\n    // the above code creates a circle wherever mouse's current position and fills it either black or white based on the mouseIsPressed\n}\n```\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [p5.js | get started](http://p5js.org/get-started/) The official documentation\n- [Code!
